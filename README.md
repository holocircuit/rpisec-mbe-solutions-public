# rpisec-mbe-solutions
Solutions to the lab exercises from the RPISEC MBE course, including any scripts/exploits written, and notes about how I went about analysing the binary / writing an exploit.

I primarily use radare2 for static analysis (especially visual graph mode which you can get by running `VV @ main`), and gdb-peda as a debugger.
