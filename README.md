Solutions to the reverse engineering challenges from RPISEC MBE.

I primarily used radare2 for static analysis (especially visual graph mode which you can get by running `VV @ main`), and gdb-peda as a debugger.

(I'm also writing up solutions to the warzone exercises in private repository - let me know if you want access.)
