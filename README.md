# rpisec-mbe-solutions-public
Solutions to the reverse engineering challenges from RPISEC MBE.

I primarily used radare2 for static analysis (especially visual graph mode which you can get by running `VV @ main`), and gdb-peda as a debugger.

## What about the labs?
I'm also writing up solutions for the main lab exercises, but am keeping these in a private repository. Let me know if you would like access.
